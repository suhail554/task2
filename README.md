OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT:create a C++ program to develop a simple calculator that performs the arithmetic opertions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division ,allow the user to inpuut two numbers and choose an  operation to perfrom
OBJECTIVES:
Here are the key objectives for a simple calculator program in C++:

1. **User Input**: Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

2. **Perform Calculation**: Execute the chosen mathematical operation on the two numbers.

3. **Display Results**: Show the result of the calculation to the user.

4. **Handle Division by Zero**: Ensure the program can handle cases where the user attempts to divide by zero.

5. **Repeat or Exit**: Allow the user to perform additional calculations or exit the program.

6. **Validate Input**: Check that the user inputs are valid numbers and handle invalid inputs gracefully.
